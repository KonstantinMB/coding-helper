To use an existing SSH key on your Mac, you typically need to ensure the SSH key is correctly configured and loaded into the SSH agent if necessary. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

### 1. Locate Your SSH Key
First, you need to locate your SSH key. The default location for SSH keys is the `~/.ssh` directory. You can check this directory to see if your keys are there. Common key filenames are `id_rsa` for RSA keys or `id_ed25519` for Ed25519 keys.

```bash
ls ~/.ssh
```

### 2. Ensure Permissions Are Correct
SSH keys need to have the right permissions set to be secure and function correctly. You can set the correct permissions using:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa      # For the private key
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  # For the public key
```
Replace `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` with your actual key filenames if they are different.

### 3. Start the SSH Agent
The SSH agent handles keys and will keep your private key in memory while you're logged in. You can start the agent with:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

### 4. Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent
To add your private key to the SSH agent, use the `ssh-add` command:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

If something doesn't go as planned:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
